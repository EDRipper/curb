# roadmap

built iteratively, in the open. checked items are live on the deployed
link, not just merged.

- [x] repo + scaffold (Next.js/TS/Tailwind)
- [x] landing page with real program pitch (not lorem ipsum)
- [x] deployed: https://curb-theta.vercel.app (Vercel, connected to this
      repo's `main` branch for auto-deploy). GitHub Pages retired — Euan
      provided a Vercel token, sidestepping the signup wall entirely.
      DATABASE_URL is set as a production env var on Vercel.
- [x] Hack Club Auth (`auth.hackclub.com`) sign-in — Euan registered the
      OAuth app himself and handed over client id/secret. real OAuth2 flow
      implemented (`app/login/route.ts` starts it with a signed state
      cookie, `app/OAuth/callback/route.ts` exchanges the code, fetches
      `/api/v1/me`, upserts the User row, sets a signed session cookie via
      `jose`). tested live end to end on the deployed link: signed in with
      a real hack club account, landed on `/dashboard` showing the real
      name/email, signed out cleanly. two real users in the DB now (the
      bot's own account, and Euan's — he apparently tried it himself).
      app trust level is `community_untrusted` so users see an "unofficial
      / unverified" warning on the consent screen — worth asking Nora to
      promote it once this is further along.
- [x] Postgres + Prisma submission model — schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
      (User, Submission with before/after audit score fields), real DB
      provisioned via `npx create-db` (Prisma-hosted Postgres, no browser
      signup needed unlike vercel/neon/supabase), migrated, and
      smoke-tested with a real write+read+delete. DATABASE_URL is now set
      on Vercel production. this DB is still temporary (auto-deletes if
      unclaimed) and claiming it hits the same GitHub/Google-only login
      wall as vercel did — needs Euan's login eventually or a permanent DB.
- [ ] submission form (site url, PR/diff link, before/after screenshots)
- [ ] automated accessibility audit pipeline (axe-core, before/after score
      delta stored per submission)
- [ ] reviewer dashboard (approve / needs-changes / reject + notes)
- [ ] hours <-> reward catalog logic
- [ ] end-to-end click-through test pass on the live link
